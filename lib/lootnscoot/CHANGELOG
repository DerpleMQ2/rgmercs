5.0.0
~ grimmier updates...

- got a little behind on this...
- Major rewrite for SQl support
- Rules and items are stored in SQL db's by ItemID so we can deal with duplicate names easier.
- Settings files are .lua files, still per character but now live in `mq\config\LootNScoot\ServerName\`
- Databases live in `mq\resources\LootnScoot\ServerName\`
- Added GUI for items\rules tables, and settings.
- Actors support for all rule changes and additions.
- Actors support to share, clone, and adjust settings for any character from the driver.
- Past Looting History is recorded into a DB so you can lookup past loot.
- Personal Rules to override Global and Normal rules. (these are character specific)
- New item list to confirm or set rules for new items as you are looting.
- Keep Spells option
- Can Wear option. (for nodrop looting mostly but applys `Keep` if your race\class can equip the item.)
- Check Corpse once option
- New `directed` mode:

  - this mode will run in the background and only react to `/lns` commands or through actors messages
  - Actors support for non standalone mode.
  - call driected mode `/lua run lootnscoot directed CallingScriptname`
  - example from rgmercs lua.
    `self.Actor:send({ mailbox = 'lootnscoot', script = 'rgmercs/lib/lootnscoot', },{ who = Config.Globals.CurLoadedChar, directions = 'doloot', })`
    in this example script = is the path to where you have lootnscoot included in your project. who = your characters name however you want to store it.
