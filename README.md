**RGMercs** is designed to transform your group from a jumbled mix of ***suspect social hotkeys***, ***asinine alt-tabbing*** and ***carpal-tunnel clicking*** into a **HIGH-FUNCTIONING SLAUGHTER MACHINE**.

**"THIS SOUNDS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, ALGAR!"** <sup>(said nobody, but let's pretend)</sup>

**I would like to turn my PUNY-PARTY-OF-PITIFUL into a <ins>GORILLA-GROUP-OF-GREATNESS</ins>... tell me more!**

&nbsp;

## RGMercs Let Beginners Go Bonkers

- RGMercs features preconfigured default "class configs" to get you into the action ASAP.*
- The scripts level with you, handling spell selection and ability use.
- Sensible default settings allow you to be productive from your first run! 
- *This means **no** ini editing, no hours of homework on a new class... we help flatten the EQ/MQ learning curve.*

<sup>* Currently, RGMercs has default configs for Live/Test, EQ Might, Project Lazarus, and "WIP" configs for The Hidden Forest. Other emu servers should have a reasonable starting point using these configs!</sup>

## We Are Crazy About Convenience

- Use our travel module to direct a peer to port your party.
- Use our clicky module to quickly add items to use, in or out of combat.
- Use our pull module to direct your dudes in their death-dealing endeavours while you destroy that bag of Doritos.**
- Our GUI is designed to put the full power of the script at your fingertips! RGMercs features fully searchable in-game command lists, FAQs and settings, whick keeps you in the game and leaves your browser windows free for... better things.***
- Don't feel like clicking around? Rather make a hotkey? Command-Line Commando? Anything that you can find in the GUI can be done via CLI instead.

<sup>** RGMercs developers do not support or condone any form of AFK play unless specifically allowed by a particular emu server... so, make sure you don't get crumbs in your keeb, dweeb.</sup>

## We Go Gaga for Granularity

Getting settled in? Asking "why is that doing (that thing you don't like)?" RGMercs allows fine-tune control of nearly every aspect of use by putting a wealth of options at your fingertips. There is no "our way or the highway" here!

- Our core settings allow you to change targeting priority, engagement criteria, or even disable automation such as combat nav or auto-targeting, allowing you to choose how much automation you prefer.
- Our autotarget system allows on-the-fly manual overrides, such as forcing or ignoring particular targets.
- Our default class configs are flexible, allowing easy toggles and criteria for use of many abilities, or even mode changes (Put your SHD into DPS mode, or your SHM into hybrid mode).
- Not finding exactly what you like? Playing on an emu server that doesnt have a default config? Our class configs are 100% customizable, allowing you to do... just about anything.****
- There is no combat automation that is *more* flexible. **You can tell RGMercs to jump and you can tell it how high**. 

<sup>**** Setting yourself up with an editor (such as [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) and using tools such as [mq-definitions](https://github.com/macroquest/mq-definitions) will greatly enhance your MQ coding in Lua! It does not take a professional developer, 99% of what I know about Lua, I learned by tinkering with this project... first as a user, then as a developer. DONT BE SKERD</sup>

*The Force Target Window can often replace your XT window entirely and add enhanced RGMercs controls.*

*Pick and choose options in the configs to tailor directly towards your setup, level or preference!*

- Feedback is always requested and taken seriously. PRs and other contributions are always welcome!
- Additionally, this script is and will remain FOSS (Free, open-source software).

To make a suggestion, or ask a question, find us on the RG Discord (in our #rg-mercs channel), the RG Forums, or any "MQ" discord channel for our supported emu servers.
